let the user buy one. This must be a \"Widget\" because it should be an independent module that can be embedded in any Web application. I am an Angular developer, therefore I will write a reusable component for an Angular application.\nThe widget is composed of:\n\na vendor area\na parking slots area.\n\nThe vendor area should list the features of the vendor in a togglable manner. It should act as a filter for parking slots.\nThe parking slot area contains all the parking slots.\n\nYou should design parking slots as \"blocks\" aligned differently between desktop and mobile devices: horizontally on desktop devices and vertically on mobile ones.\nInside each parking slot you can insert the info about the parking slot itself.\nA parking slot should be selectable by the user.\nClicking one of the parking slots in the Widget will add the parking slot to the shopping cart of the host Web app.\nAdd a button show/hide details (the map and the features list) of the selected parking slot\n\nBuilding\nBefore building the widget install all dependencies with the command:\nnpm installTo build the widget issue the following command from the root of the repository structure:\nng build widgetThe project will be built in the dist/widget directory.\nDocumentation\nThe widget's API documentation is available by clicking the docs badge at the beginning of this page.\nThe documentation can be generated with:\nnpm run compodocThe generated documentation will be in the docs folder for interoperability\nwith GitHub Pages and the above link.\nTranslating\nThe tool ng-packgr still does not support\nexporting assets with the package so translations are not yet available with this\nrelease. As soon as the relevant pull request\nwill be released it will be possible to resume work on this feature.\nMaking it available\nThe public way\nIssue the command npm publish command after testing, and building the widget to\nhave it published in the default npm registry. You must be logged in the default\nregistry for this to work.\nThen run npm install parking-widget to install in any project.\nThe easy way\nCopy the dist/widget folder in the node_modules folder of the destination project.\nThe demo project is already setup to get the package from that folder. Don't symlink it,\nas it will not work that way!\nThe hard way\nYou could install a local copy of an NPM registry (like Verdaccio from https://verdaccio.org/),\nconfigure it, and start it. It must act as an NPM registry proxy, too. This is still work in progress.\nResults of publishing\nThe test proejct it at https://github.com/marcobuschini/interview-november-2019. It the widget was\ninstalled \"the easy way\" described above.\nTranslating\nThis widget uses NGX Translate for internationalization. To extract\nthe strings to translate use the command npm run extract-i18n. This will generate the file\nprojects/widget/assets/i18n/strings.pot that can feeded into any translation tool that generates\ntranslations in JSON format, such as OneSky. Download the translated\nfiles ZIP archive and unpack it into the projects/widget/assets/i18n/ folder.\nBibliography\n\nAngular documentation\nAngular Material documentation\nAngular Package Format documentation\nNGX Translate\nNPM documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2019 Marco Buschini\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
